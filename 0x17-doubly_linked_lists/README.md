## C - Doubly Linked Lists
> Each file in this directory holds code that illustrates an essential concept of manipulating doubly linked lists by printing, inserting, deleting nodes, freeing nodes and using the node data (e.g to get a total sum)

### Description of what each file shows:
* lists.h - Header file with structure defined and function prototypes
* files that start with:

0. prints all the elements
1. returns the number of elements in linked list
2. adds a new node at the beginning
3. adds a new node at the end
4. frees linked list
5. returns the nth node
6. returns the sum of all the data in list
7. inserts a new node at a given position
8. deletes the node at index

### Environment
* Language: C
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04
* Compiler: gcc 4.8.4
* Style guidelines: [Betty Style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)
